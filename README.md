### Group Members: Tarekegne Aboye, Yang Bo, Gannon Traynor, Soobin Kim

# Project Overview 
User accounts in Twitter can be categorized in many different ways. For example, whether there are humans or bots, individuals or organizations. They also can be classified based on their affiliation (government, non-profit, commercial ...etc), or their interest field (politics, academia, entertainment.. etc). There are many research and open-source projects that attempted to achieve this task form different. Most open projects (see References) have several issues:

-The code is not maintained and contains components that are outdated and need some debugging.  
-The project is not documented well.  
-The project doesn't perform real-time classification.   

# How to Install
1. Download FDSetup.exe
2. Go through install process
3. Enter the follower_display_revised folder
4. Run follower_display.exe application

This program asks the user to input a Twitter username and returns the associated follower count. 

# Vision
User Classification in Twitter is going to build upon a few older projects that had a similar idea. The goal of this project is to create a program that can identify
what type of user a Twitter account is based on different features, wether it's a bot, an advertisement page, a corporate/company page, a social media influencer/celebrity or just an everyday
average joe. While looking through the other respositories I noticed a few things that will make a good starting point. There are already a few training models buiot out in jupyterlabs although they are outdated
and will need to be outfitted. Before we do that we will have to do some tests to determine which features are the best predictor of a twitters accounts user type. 

FOR people who work in marketing and advertising who utilize social media monitoring WHO want a way to sort Twitter users, THE UCT program is a tool for Twitter THAT classifies users based on categories such as whether they're influencers, consumers, or politicans. UNLIKE other apps developed through Twitter's developer portal that show portions of data, OUR program provides a simple to use interface that displays a lot of data about individual users that show whether they're relevant for collecting marketing information.
# Personas

## Marketing Persona (Soobin Kim)
Jim is a 30 year old that lives near the World Trade Center in New York City, New York. He has a Bachelor's Degree in Market Research from New York University. Lately he works for Kantar, a market research company founded in London, England but with locations in many other countries. He spends most of his day online, but likes to go out for walks to enjoy the architecture and art in the city in his free time. 

Jim not only uses social media for personal entertainment, he also analyzes data from these sites as his job. He utilizes social media monitoring to develop an understanding of consumer wants and needs and delivers this information to his clients. He would find the UCT program useful when monitoring Twitter to classify companies vs. consumers and see the interactions of both of these categories of users. 

## Recruiting Persona.  
Tony is a hr manager and recruiter at a software development company in Silicon Valley. He is responsible for finding and contacting potential employee. Tony is able to use the User Classification program in twitter (uct) to assist his work. With the program he is able to narrow down to specify standard users and avoid wasting time looking at twitter accounts that are run by companies, or are bots. He is also able to find users that are active in the tech community and often talk about software development and other topics on their twitter account. UCT helps Tony find suitable candidates from a pool of a billion people.

## Exporter Persona

Samuel is 44 years old and works in the international relations department of a private exporter company. He holds a degree in Business Administration from the country's educational institution. He also has some experience in technology and was born in Ethiopia. Samuel's company exports its products to different countries through its brokers, but since Samuel came to this company, he has been using various social media to communicate directly with the company's existing and new customers to make their services more reliable. 

As social networking helps different companies to express their products, services, and ideas, Samuel also uses a Twitter account in the company to promote his company's products and strengthen his relationship with various sections of the community to make the organization more profitable. However, to make the companyâ€™s product accessible to buyers in different countries and to strengthen the relationship between seller and buyer, he found the importance of the UCT program (user classification in Twitter) as a key to play a role in the company.
