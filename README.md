## Marketing Persona (Soobin Kim)
Jim is a 30 year old that lives near the World Trade Center in New York City, New York. He has a Bachelor's Degree in Market Research from New York University. Lately he works for Kantar, a market research company founded in London, England but with locations in many other countries. He spends most of his day online, but likes to go out for walks to enjoy the architecture and art in the city in his free time. 

Jim not only uses social media for personal entertainment, he also analyzes data from these sites as his job. He utilizes social media monitoring to develop an understanding of consumer wants and needs and delivers this information to his clients. He would find the UCT program useful when monitoring Twitter to classify companies vs. consumers and see the interactions of both of these categories of users.
