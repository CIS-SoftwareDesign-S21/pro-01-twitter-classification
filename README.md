## Marketing Persona (Soobin Kim)
Jim is a 30 year old that lives near the World Trade Center in New York City, New York. He has a Bachelor's Degree in Market Research from New York University. Lately he works for Kantar, a market research company founded in London, England but with locations in many other countries. He spends most of his day online, but likes to go out for walks to enjoy the architecture and art in the city in his free time. 

Jim not only uses social media for personal entertainment, he also analyzes data from these sites as his job. He utilizes social media monitoring to develop an understanding of consumer wants and needs and delivers this information to his clients. He would find the UCT program useful when monitoring Twitter to classify companies vs. consumers and see the interactions of both of these categories of users.

Exporter Persona

Samuel is 44 years old and works in the international relations department of a private exporter company. He holds a degree in Business Administration from the country's educational institution. He also has some experience in technology and was born in Ethiopia. Samuel's company exports its products to different countries through its brokers, but since Samuel came to this company, he has been using various social media to communicate directly with the company's existing and new customers to make their services more reliable. 

As social networking helps different companies to express their products, services, and ideas, Samuel also uses a Twitter account (UCT) in the company to promote his company's products and strengthen his relationship with various sections of the community to make the organization more profitable.
